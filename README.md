# Notes
I made this web app as a project to practice my programming skills. I know the app has still a lot of bugs, code is a bit messy, and is not yet streamlined which I've yet to solve in my free time. As of writing, I still have my day job as a chemical engineer and also I'm studying computer science and software engineering after the day.
